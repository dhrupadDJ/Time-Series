# Apple Stock Price Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project aims to forecast Apple's stock prices using various statistical and machine learning models including ARIMA, ARIMAX, and XGBoost. The project utilizes historical stock price data to train these models and evaluates their performance based on precision metrics.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Anaconda (recommended)

### Libraries Required
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- statsmodels
- seaborn
- xgboost

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib sklearn statsmodels seaborn xgboost
```

Alternatively, if you are using Anaconda, use the following:

```bash
conda install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels seaborn
conda install -c conda-forge xgboost
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation
Load and preprocess the data by converting dates and performing differencing to make the data stationary.

### Model Building
Build and train ARIMA and ARIMAX models for univariate and multivariate time series forecasting, respectively. Additionally, utilize XGBoost for a machine learning approach.

### Evaluation
Evaluate the models using precision as the metric, and visualize the forecasts against actual stock prices.

### Backtesting
Perform backtesting to evaluate the model performance over different time intervals.

### Running the Scripts
To run the main script, navigate to the project directory and execute:

```bash
python main.py
```
